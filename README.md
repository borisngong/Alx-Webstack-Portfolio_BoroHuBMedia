# BoroHubMedia Social Media REST API

A backend REST API for a social media platform with basic CRUD operations for members, posts, comments and chats.

## Introduction

BoroHubMedia is a backend REST API for a social media platform. It is built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB and has endpoints for authenticating members, member management, posts, comments and chats. The API provides member authentication, member management, post and comment functionalities, likes/dislikes, and robust error checking and response utilities.

### Diagram Explanation

- **Client**: Represents the members accessing the API through various clients like mobile apps or web applications.
- **API Server**: Built with Node.js and Express, handling requests and responses.
- **Database**: MongoDB serves as the data storage layer, managing member data, posts, comments, and chats.
- **Authentication**: Demonstrates how member authentication is managed through JWT tokens.

## Features

- **Authentication Management**: Account initialization, access Account(login), endSession(logout), and session retrieval.
- **Member Management**: Profile updates, following/unfollowing, and member restrictions(block/unblock), member access token refresh.
- **Content Post Management**: Create, update, retrieve, like/unlike, and delete posts.
- **Comment Management**: Create, update, retrieve, like/unlike, reply to comments, like/dislike comment replies, and delete comments.
- **Chat Management**: Create chat, chatEntry(send messages), retrieve and delete chat capabilities for members.

## Architectural Overview

The BoroHubMedia API is structured in a modular way, allowing for clear separation of concerns and maintainability. Hereâ€™s a high-level overview of the architecture:

1. **Server**: The API is built on an Express server, which handles incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate controllers.

2. **Controllers**: Each controller (e.g., `MemberController`, `ContentController`) contains static methods that define the logic for handling requests related to specific resources. They interact with the models to perform CRUD operations and return responses.

3. **Models**: The API uses Mongoose models (e.g., `Member`, `Content`, `Comment`) to define the structure of the data stored in MongoDB. These models represent the database schema and provide methods for interacting with the database.

4. **Middleware**: Middleware functions (e.g., for authentication, error handling, CORS) are used to process requests before they reach the controllers. This allows for reusable logic that can be applied to multiple routes.

5. **Routes**: The API defines routes for different functionalities (e.g., authentication, member management, content management) that map to the appropriate controller methods.

6. **Error Handling**: A centralized error handling mechanism ensures that errors are caught and formatted consistently, providing meaningful feedback to clients.

7. **Database**: MongoDB is used as the database to store member information, posts, comments, and chat data. The API connects to the database using Mongoose.

This architecture promotes scalability and maintainability, making it easier to add new features and manage existing ones.

## HTTP Status Codes and Error Handling

The API employs comprehensive error handling to ensure a smooth member experience. Below are the common HTTP status codes you may encounter, along with their meanings:

### Success Codes

- **200 OK**: The request was successful, and the server returned the requested data.
- **201 Created**: The request was successful, and a new resource was created (e.g., a new content post).
- **204 No Content**: The request was successful, but there is no content to return (e.g., after a successful delete operation).

### Client Error Codes

- **400 Bad Request**: The request could not be processed due to invalid input or missing parameters.
- **401 Unauthorized**: The request requires member authentication or the provided credentials are invalid.
- **403 Forbidden**: The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource was not found or does not exist on the server.
- **409 Conflict**: The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource.
- **429 Too Many Requests**: The member has sent too many requests in a given amount of time(e.g Rate limiting for when a member attempts more than five times within 5mins to login with wrong handle or password).

### Server Error Codes

- **500 Internal Server Error**: The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
- **503 Service Unavailable**: The server is currently unable to handle the request due to temporary overloading or maintenance.

### Error Responses

Error responses will include a JSON object with a message detailing the error. For example:

```json
{
  "error": "Too many requests. Please try again later",
  "status": 429
}
```

Additionally, the API utilizes a custom error handling function called BDERROR to standardize error responses. It also provides utility functions, sendSuccessResponse and sendErrorResponse, to ensure that all responses are formatted uniformly. This enhances the overall user experience by providing clear and consistent feedback to the client.

## Prerequisites for Testing BoroHubMedia API by Creating Your Database and .env File

Follow the link to download and install MongoDB

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/): Database management system used to store data for the API.

## Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Set Up MongoDB Connection

You can either use **MongoDB Atlas (cloud)** or install **MongoDB locally**.

#### Option 1: MongoDB Atlas (Cloud)

1. Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and create an account
2. Log in and set up a new cluster (choose the free option for testing purposes)
3. Create a new database in your cluster

#### Option 2: MongoDB Local

1. Follow the [installation instructions here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/).
2. Start the MongoDB service by running the `mongod` command in your terminal.

---

### Step 2: Create a `.env` File

In the BoroHubMedia_Backend directory, create a `.env` file to store your environment variables:

Create the .env file:

```bash
touch .env
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

To configure your environment variables, create a `.env` file in the `BoroHubMedia_Backend` directory and add the following variables:

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

To configure your environment variables, create a `.env` file in the `BoroHubMedia_Backend` directory and add the following variables:

```plaintext
PORT=3000
DB_URI="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=<appName>"
SKEY_JWT="<your_secret_key_here>"
EXP_JWT="<expiration_time>"
UPLOADS_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000" # Change to your server URL
REFRESH_JWT="<your_refresh_token_here>"
SKEY_JWT_REFRESH="<your_refresh_secret_key_here>"
EXP_JWT_REFRESH="<refresh_expiration_time>"
```

## N.B

- Ensure that you replace the placeholder with actual values values (like `<expiration_time>`, `your_secret_key_here`, `<your_refresh_token_here>`, `<username>`, `<password>`, etc.) with your actual credentials and preferred settings.
- This `.env` file is crucial for your application to run correctly, as it contains sensitive information and configurations.

### Explanation of Environment Variables:

- **`PORT`**: Port number for the server (default: 3000).
- **`SKEY_JWT`**: Secret key for signing JWT tokens.
- **`EXP_JWT`**: Expiration time for JWT tokens (e.g., `24h` for 24 hours).
- **`UPLOADS_BASE_URL`**: Base URL for media uploads.
- **`DB_URI`**: MongoDB connection string. Replace `<username>`, `<password>`, `<cluster>`, and `<database>` with your actual MongoDB Atlas credentials that you created above.
- **`SKEY_JWT_REFRESH`**: Secret key for signing refresh tokens.
- **`EXP_JWT_REFRESH`**: Expiration time for refresh tokens.
- **`REFRESH_JWT`**: Refresh token for authentication.

---

You can now proceed to run the api with your .env and Database following step 3 above **RUN API**

## Basic Usage

Once the API is running, you can use a REST API client (like Postman or Insomnia) to interact with the API endpoints. These endpoints allow you to manage authentication, members, content posts, feedback comments, and chat functionalities. You can test the API endpoints using the Postman collection provided in the documentation section below.

### Default Base URL

The default base URL for the server is:

```plaintext
http://localhost:3000
```

If you are running the API on a different port, remember to replace localhost:3000 with the appropriate base URL.

## API Documentation

For detailed information on request parameters, response formats, and example payloads, check out the following resources:

- **Swagger Static Documentation**: Access the this Url for VIEW ONLY when the sever is running: [Link for VIEW ONLY since swagger do not accept automatic authentication using cookies, but allows manual authentication using them, This API is design to use cookies for authencation](http://localhost:3000/api-docs)
- **Postman Collection**: Access the this Url for view:. [Link to BoroHubMedia API Documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/40210928/2sAYQggTiW)
- **Test Postman Collection**: Access this Url for API test: [Link to BoroHubMedia API Testing](https://www.postman.com/joint-operations-specialist-41505418/workspace/my-workspace/request/40210928-2b7fd524-3d0d-4693-9710-815f0c9471e4?action=share&creator=40210928&ctx=documentation&active-environment=40210928-c969341f-fbc9-401b-bb4c-d32e6f52f988)
  This resource will help you manage authentication, members, content posts, feedback comments, and chat functionalities.

### Using a REST API Client

Using a REST API client (like Postman or Insomnia) to interact with the endpoints. I chosed this tools because they are particularly useful for API testing during development for the following reasons:

- **Automatic Authorization**: Unlike tools like Swagger, which require manual entry of authorization headers or tokens, Postman and Insomnia automatically handle cookies populated by the API. This simplifies the testing process for APIs like mine that are designed to populate cookies automatically.

- **Streamlined Testing Workflow**: Postman and Insomnia offer advanced features for testing, such as saving request/response pairs, managing collections, and great debugging tools, which makes them a better choice in development and testing.

Since my API automatically populates cookies, using Postman or Insomnia ensures that you can efficiently test protected endpoints without the need for repetitive manual configurations(e.g setting the headers, tokens etc).

## API Endpoint Structure

The API's routes are organized under specific paths based on their functionalities.

---

### Authentication Routes

- **Base Route**: `/api/auth`
- **Example**:
  - **POST** `/api/auth/initializeAccount`
    Initializes a new account.

---

### Content Post Routes

- **Base Route**: `/api/content`
- **Example**:
  - **DELETE** `/api/content/delete-content/:postId`
    Deletes a content post by its ID.

---

### Member Management Routes

- **Base Route**: `/api/member`
- **Example**:
  - **PUT** `/api/member/follow/:memberId`
    Follows a specific member by their ID.

---

### Comment Management Routes

- **Base Route**: `/api/comment`
- **Example**:
  - **PUT** `/api/comment/update-comment/:commentId`
    Updates a specific comment by its ID.

---

### Chat Management Routes

- **Base Route**: `/api/chat`
- **Example**:
  - **GET** `/api/chat/get-chat/:chatID`
    Retrieves a specific chat by its ID.

---

## Summary

To access any of the above functionalities, append the relevant endpoint to the base URL if you havn't ser environment in either Postman, Insomnia etc. For example, to create a new content post, you would use:

```plaintext
POST http://localhost:3000/api/content/create-content-images/:memberID
```

Remeber to replace **Port Number** with actual port you're using

```

This is a high-level overview of the project structure.

## Definitions

- **Content**: A post created by a member, which may include text and optional media files.
- **Member**: A registered user on the platform.
- **Middleware**: Functions that handle requests and responses, including error handling and processing.
- **Endpoints**: API routes that facilitate interaction with the application.
- **API**: A set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications.
- **Request**: A message sent by a client to a server to initiate an action or retrieve data.
- **Response**: A message sent by a server back to a client, containing the result of the requested action.
- **Authentication**: The process of verifying the identity of a member before granting access to certain features or data.
- **Authorization**: The process of determining whether a member has permission to perform a specific action or access certain resources.
- **Database**: A structured collection of data that is stored and managed for retrieval and manipulation.
- **Schema**: A blueprint or structure that defines how data is organized in a database, including tables and relationships.

### Common Issues

1. **Port Already in Use**:

   - Ensure no other process is running on the specified port.
   - Kill any processes using the port with:
     ```bash
     kill $(lsof -t -i:3000)
     ```

2. **MongoDB Connection Issues**:

   - Verify MongoDB URI and credentials in the `.env` file.
     -It is also good to add the willd card IP 0.0.0.0 to the access IP so that you can acces from all environments

3. **Missing Dependencies**:

   - If you encounter a "Module Not Found" error for `dotenv`, ensure that you have installed it by running:
     ```bash
     npm install dotenv
     ```

4. **Node.js Version**:

   - Ensure you are using Node.js version 16.x or later. You can check your Node.js version with:
     ```bash
     node -v
     ```

5. **Environment Variable Errors**:
   - Double-check your `.env` file for missing or incorrect variables.

### Features to Add

- Implement WebSocket-based real-time notifications.
- Develop advanced member and post search features.
- Introduce caching (e.g., Redis) to improve performance.
- Intend to add more detailed comprehensive documentation using Swagger, populating it whose local host link is already running in the api when started
  .

### Optimization Plans

- Optimize queries to increase response speeds.
- Incorporate analytics dashboards for user insights.

### User Experience

- Create a user-friendly frontend to showcase the API's capabilities.
